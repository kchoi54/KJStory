There once lived a boy named Alex. At the time, he was a freshman in UW Madison, and his first day in UW Madison was about to start the nextday. He was very excited to start his college life at UW Madison. 
But he needed a few more materials for class. So he went to the nearby store to buy some notebooks and pens. He was excited for every minute inside.
Once he gathered his materials, Alex decided to go to a party the night before his first day. He had never experienced anything similar in high school. His excitement only grew greater after this.
