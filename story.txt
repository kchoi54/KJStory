There once lived a boy named Alex. At the time, he was a freshman in UW Madison, and his first day in UW Madison was about to start the nextday. He was very excited to start his college life at UW Madison. 
But he needed a few more materials for class. So he went to the nearby store to buy some notebooks and pens. He was excited for every minute inside.
Once he gathered his materials, Alex decided to go to a party the night before his first day. He had never experienced anything similar in high school. His excitement only grew greater after this.  Alex was so amazed by his party experience that he decided not to go to class the next day.  In fact, he figured he would just party for the of college.  And that's exactly what he did: day in and day out he partied.  That man grew up to be Bill Gates.
After his success, he would reminisce his college life and think "those days were the best days of my lives. I really learned a lot in Madison. I would never be this sucessful with out UW Madison". And he happily lived the rest of his life.
THE END
